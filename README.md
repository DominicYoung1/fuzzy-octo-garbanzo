  + A page where you can input what ingredients you have and submit all at once (5)
  + A page to show what dishes match your ingredients and select a dish. (8)
  + A page to show what ingredients you are missing from selected dishes. (10)

#### Backend
  + We need a way to store recipe data (2)
  + A way to look up the ingredients for a given recipe (4)
  + A way to tabulate ingredients already owned by the user (6)
  + A way to serve up a list of recipes that satisfy all the inputted ingredients (7)
  + A way to present what ingredients are missing from multiple recipes (9)
  + A way to submit new recipes we want the backend to store and have as options. (3)
